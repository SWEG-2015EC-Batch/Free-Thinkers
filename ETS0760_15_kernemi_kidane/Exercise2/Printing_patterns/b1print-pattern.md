# Problem analysis

Input: none

Output:  rectangle, a hollow rectangle, a half pyramid, an inverted half pyramid, a hollow inverted half pyramid, and a full pyramid.

Operation: 

1.Solid Rectangle:

   - Nested loops iterate over rows (`i`) and columns (`j`).
   
   - The program prints `*` for each iteration.

2.Hollow Rectangle:

   - Similar nested loops with conditions to print `*` only at the border (i.e., first and last row, first and last column).
   
   - Prints spaces for the inner part of the rectangle.

3. Half Pyramid:
   
   - Nested loops for rows (`i`) and columns (`j`).

   - Prints `*` in increasing order in each row.

4. Inverted Half Pyramid:

   - Nested loops for rows (`i`) and columns (`j`).

   - Prints `*` in decreasing order in each row.

5. Hollow Inverted Half Pyramid:

   - Similar nested loops with conditions to print `*` only at the border (first column, last column, first row, last row).

   - Prints spaces for the inner part of the inverted pyramid.

6. Full Pyramid:

   - Nested loops for rows (`i`), columns (`j`), and spaces (`k`).

   - Prints spaces to align the pyramid and `*` in increasing order in each row.

## Pseudocode

Step1:start

Step2: do the following 

1.Solid Rectangle:

   - Nested loops iterate over rows (`i`) and columns (`j`).
   
   - The program prints `*` for each iteration.

2.Hollow Rectangle:

   - Similar nested loops with conditions to print `*` only at the border (i.e., first and last row, first and last column).
   
   - Prints spaces for the inner part of the rectangle.

3. Half Pyramid:

   - Nested loops for rows (`i`) and columns (`j`).

   - Prints `*` in increasing order in each row.

4. Inverted Half Pyramid:
 
   - Nested loops for rows (`i`) and columns (`j`).

   - Prints `*` in decreasing order in each row.

5. Hollow Inverted Half Pyramid:

   - Similar nested loops with conditions to print `*` only at the border (first column, last column, first row, last row).

   - Prints spaces for the inner part of the inverted pyramid.

6. Full Pyramid:

   - Nested loops for rows (`i`), columns (`j`), and spaces (`k`).

   - Prints spaces to align the pyramid and `*` in increasing order in each row.

Step3:endline after each step
