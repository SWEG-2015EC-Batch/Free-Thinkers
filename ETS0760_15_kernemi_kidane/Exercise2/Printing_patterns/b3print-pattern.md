# Problem analysis

Input: none

Output: Number in Rectangle, Number in Triangle, Flipped Version of Number in Triangle, ‘abcde' in Rectangle, 'ABCDE' in Triangle and ‘A-X' in Rectangle Operation: 

1.Number in Rectangle:

   - Nested loops for rows (`i`) and columns (`j`).
   
   - Prints the value of `j` in each iteration.

2. Number in Triangle:

   - Nested loops for rows (`i`) and columns (`j`).

   - Prints the value of `j` in each iteration, up to the current row number.

3. Flipped Version of Number in Triangle:

   - Nested loops for rows (`i`), spaces (`j`), and columns (`k`).

   - Prints spaces to align the flipped triangle.

   - Prints the value of `k` in decreasing order in each row.

4. 'abcde' in Rectangle:

   - Nested loops for rows (`i`) and characters (`ch`).

   - Prints characters 'a' to 'e' in each iteration.

5. 'ABCDE' in Triangle:

   - Nested loops for rows (`i`) and characters (`ch`).

   - Prints characters 'A' to 'E' in each iteration, incrementing the character after printing.

6. 'A-X' in Rectangle:

   - Nested loops for rows (`i`), columns (`j`), and characters (`ch`).

   - Prints characters 'A' to 'X' in each iteration, incrementing the character after printing.

## Pseudocode

Step1:start

Step2: do the following 

1.Number in Rectangle:

   - Nested loops for rows (`i`) and columns (`j`).
   
   - Prints the value of `j` in each iteration.

2. Number in Triangle:

   - Nested loops for rows (`i`) and columns (`j`).

   - Prints the value of `j` in each iteration, up to the current row number.

3. Flipped Version of Number in Triangle:

   - Nested loops for rows (`i`), spaces (`j`), and columns (`k`).

   - Prints spaces to align the flipped triangle.

   - Prints the value of `k` in decreasing order in each row.

4. 'abcde' in Rectangle:

   - Nested loops for rows (`i`) and characters (`ch`).

   - Prints characters 'a' to 'e' in each iteration.

5. 'ABCDE' in Triangle:

   - Nested loops for rows (`i`) and characters (`ch`).

   - Prints characters 'A' to 'E' in each iteration, incrementing the character after printing.

6. 'A-X' in Rectangle:

   - Nested loops for rows (`i`), columns (`j`), and characters (`ch`).

   - Prints characters 'A' to 'X' in each iteration, incrementing the character after printing.
