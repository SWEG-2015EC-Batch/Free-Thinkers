# Problem analysis

Input: none

Output:  inverted pyramid and hollow full pyramid

Operation: 

1. Inverted Pyramid:

   - Nested loops for rows (`i`), spaces (`j`), and asterisks (`k`).

   - Prints spaces to align the inverted pyramid.

   - Prints `*` characters in decreasing order in each row.

2. Hollow Full Pyramid:

   - Similar nested loops for rows (`i`), spaces (`j`), and asterisks (`k`).

   - Prints spaces to align the pyramid.

   - Prints `*` characters only at the first and last column and the first row, last row.


   - Prints spaces for the inner part of the pyramid.

## Pseudocode

Step1:start

Step2: do the following 

1. Inverted Pyramid:

   - Nested loops for rows (`i`), spaces (`j`), and asterisks (`k`).

   - Prints spaces to align the inverted pyramid.

   - Prints `*` characters in decreasing order in each row.

2. Hollow Full Pyramid:

   - Similar nested loops for rows (`i`), spaces (`j`), and asterisks (`k`).

   - Prints spaces to align the pyramid.

   - Prints `*` characters only at the first and last column and the first row, last row.

   - Prints spaces for the inner part of the pyramid.

Step3:endline after each step

Step4: Print the patterns
