# Problem analysis

Input: none

Output: 
-numbers from 10 to 49 in pattern

Operation: 

-Initialize by setting a variable i to 10, which represents the starting number.

-For each iteration of the loop, print the value of i followed by a space.

-Check if i is the 10th number in the line or the last number. If true, move to the next line.

-Increment the value of i by 1.

-Repeat the loop until i reaches 50.

##Pseudocode
Step1:start


Step2: Initialize (set i=10)

Step3:Loop(for (int i = 10; i <= 49; ++i))

Step4: if (i is the 10th number in the line or i is the last number), move to next line

Step5:Print i and “ ”

Step6:end
